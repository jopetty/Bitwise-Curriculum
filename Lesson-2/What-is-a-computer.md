# Bitwise 02: What Is a Computer?
Given that this is a course dealing with computers, it would probably be a good idea to begin by understanding just what a computer is.

### What Is a Computer
At its most basic level, a computer is a device that is designed with two key aspects in mind. 1) It must be able to carry out a defined set of operations or computations, and 2) it must be able to be programmed to preform those operations. This encompasses many different types of computers from many different periods of history. Today, the kind of computer we are most familiar with is a personal computer; this is the kind of computer that is most likely sitting on your desk or laptop right now. However, the word computer has meant different things at different points in time. To an engineer from the 1930s, the idea of a computer as a small aluminium box that sits on your lap would have been a rather novel concept. To get an idea of what the first computers were like, we have to go back in time a bit farther than the 20th century.

### Understanding the History of Computers
Probably the first device that we can call a computer, instead just a fancy calculator like an abacus, is the Antikythera machine. This collection of brass gears was made in Greece and has been around for over 2200 years. It was used by the Greeks to calculate the positions of astronomical objects and predict events like eclipses. Although it wasn’t terribly accurate, due in part to the limited precision of the hand-cast gears and in part to the knowledge of physics and astronomy at the time, it is still a feat of ancient engineering. Later inventions include the slide rule, which was what people used before TI-84s, and the differential analyser, a mechanical computer that could be used to solve differential equations, which is pretty amazing.

Now, these computers all share a key difference from what we think of as modern computers, because they are all **analog**. This means that they operate using continuous values. In comparison. **digital** computers use discrete quantities. Digital computers, like Colossus and ENIAC, were developed in the 1940s for breaking codes and ciphers. These early digital computers were large and unwieldy because they used vacuum tubes, which were proportionally large and generated lots of heat. These have been replaced in computers by **transistors**, tiny electrical components made of semiconductors that form the basis of how computers preform operations.

Transistors work like tiny, tiny switches. By applying an electrical voltage to a transistor, it’s state can be changed from ‘off’ to ‘on’, or from 0 to 1. This allows computers to manipulate binary information and preform calculations. In fact, transistors are so integral to the performance of computers that they have been used as benchmarks for how computationally powerful a computer is. Early transistor computers only had a few hundred to a few thousand transistors. Since then, the number of transistors in a computer has risen amazingly fast. In 1975, Gordon Moore, co-founder of Intel, noted that the number of transistors in an integrated circuit has doubled about every two years. Currently, there are billions of transistors in personal computers. Although it is not likely that this trend can continue forever, as evidenced by the recent deceleration in production by Intel and the physical limitations to how small transistors can be made before their efficacy declines, the advancement is continuing. 

### The Components of a Computer
If we are going to learn how to develop programs for a computer, we should also understand what the parts of a computer are and how they function. Here, we will be talking about personal computers, like laptops and desktops, as opposed to embedded computer systems, like integrated circuits, or server systems, since personal computers are what most people use in their day to day lives.

All personal computers are made of smaller, specialized components which are used for different tasks; these components generally include:
* the Central Processing Unit (CPU); an integrated circuit which preforms the calculations a computer needs
* the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU); a device similar to the CPU which handles calculations for displaying images and video
* Random-Access Memory (RAM); usually just called “memory”, this stores information about what is currently running on your computer
* Storage, like solid state drives and hard drives; this stores all the data on the computer like documents, programs, and pictures of cats.
* Input devices, like mice, keyboards, trackpads, and touch screens; these are used to get information from the user to the computer
* Output devices, like screens and speakers; these are used to present information to the user.

It’s important to recognize the distinction between memory and storage. Storage is long term, and holds any data that you want to be permanent. Memory is only used when you are using your computer. For example, the programs and applications on your computer are in storage. When you run a program it is loaded into your memory so that you can use it. Most memory is volatile, meaning that it needs power in order to retain data. Once that power is removed, the memory is wiped. In contrast, storage doesn’t require power tor retain data, which is helpful every time you turn your computer off or unplug a flash drive.

## Hardware and Software
Up until this point, we have mostly dealt with the hardware components of a computer. Hardware refers to the physical elements of a computer, like the CPU and RAM. The other main element of a computer is its software; the set of instructions that run on the computers hardware. Think of the hardware as an instrument, and the software as sheet music. The sheet music is played by the user on the instrument in a similar way to how software is run on hardware.

Just like there are different types of hardware that make up a computer, there are also different types of software. 
* The **operating system** is usually considered the base level of software, and interfaces between the hardware and other pieces of software. Examples of operating systems include Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
* **Applications** run on top of the operating system, and allow users to do specific tasks. Examples of applications include Google Chrome, Microsoft Word, and iTunes.

This is, of course, a simplified picture of what a computer is. There are other important parts, like the firmware and power supply, and all of these components are made of constituent components, but this will give you a good idea of what is going on inside your computer when you use it.
