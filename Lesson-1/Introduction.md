# Bitwise 01: Introduction to Computer Science

Hello there. If you are reading this, congratulations on deciding to learn about the fascinating world of computers, electronics, mathematics, and programming known as computer science. This curriculum will cover topics like Web Development, Object Oriented Coding, Python Syntax, User Interface Design, and even the Architecture of the Internet. If you're feeling intimidated by all of that technical vocabulary, don't worry; this curriculum is designed to teach you about computer science from the ground up.

### What this course covers
Bitwise is an introductory computer science program, meaning that it will give you a good overview of many different aspects of computer science. We won't go into so much detail as to overwhelm you with new information, but rather strive to cover a broad scope of knowledge. Think of this as a "Liberal Arts Approach to Computer Science". Each lesson will cover a new topic, and will likely build upon this skills learned in the previous lesson.

In addition to talking about programming or coding, this course will touch on aspects of electrical engineering and mathematics to give you an understanding of how and why what you develop works the way it does. It will also cover concepts that at first glance may not seem like they have much to do with conventional computer science, like art, history, physics, philosophy, language, music, biology, and literature. These topics are included because computer science, like all aspects of life, does not exist in a vacuum. Whether you are a software developer or a painter, you will live in and interact with a world that contains a vast multitude of knowledge and disciplines. It is important to understand how the knowledge obtained through history, math, engineering, and art shape the development of computers and how computers shape those bodies of knowledge in turn.

### Format
Each lesson will start out roughly like this. There will be a folder named ```Lesson-n```, where ```n``` is the lesson number, and inside that folder will be a markdown file to give you an overview of what the lesson will cover, what tools will be needed, simple examples of code, tasks and objectives for each lesson, and resources for you to explore if you want to learn more about the topics covered. There will also be a folder with any files you will need to complete the lesson.

Throughout each lesson there will be a core topic such as "What is a Computer" or "Loops in Python"; this will be what the lesson is about. There will also be a list of objectives for you to complete; these will be questions about the content covered and tasks you should complete to ensure that you are learning about the topic. With the more traditional information about computer science, there will also be tie-ins to interdisciplinary themes. For the "What is a Computer" lesson, this includes interdisciplinary content such as "The physics of electricity, electrical circuits, an overview of Moore's Law, and references to and xkcd comic".
