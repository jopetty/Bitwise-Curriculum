# Bitwise 01: Introduction to Computer Science

Hello there. If you are reading this, congratulations on deciding to learn about the fascinating world of computers, electronics, mathematics, and programming known as computer science. This curriculum will cover topics like Web Development, Object Oriented Coding, Python Syntax, User Interface Design, and even the Architecture of the Internet. If you're feeling intimidated by all of that technical vocabulary, don't worry; this curriculum is designed to teach you about computer science from the ground up.

### What this course covers
Bitwise is an introductory computer science program, meaning that it will give you a good overview of many different aspects of computer science. We won't go into so much detail as to overwhelm you with new information, but rather strive to cover a broad scope of knowledge. Think of this as a "Liberal Arts Approach to Computer Science". Each lesson will cover a new topic, and will likely build upon this skills learned in the previous lesson.

In addition to talking about programming or coding, this course will touch on aspects of electrical engineering and mathematics to give you an understanding of how and why what you develop works the way it does. It will also cover concepts that at first glance may not seem like they have much to do with conventional computer science, like art, history, physics, philosophy, language, music, biology, and literature. These topics are included because computer science, like all aspects of life, does not exist in a vacuum. Whether you are a software developer or a painter, you will live in and interact with a world that contains a vast multitude of knowledge and disciplines. It is important to understand how the knowledge obtained through history, math, engineering, and art shape the development of computers and how computers shape those bodies of knowledge in turn.

### Format
Each lesson will start out roughly like this. There will be a folder named ```Lesson-n```, where ```n``` is the lesson number, and inside that folder will be a markdown file to give you an overview of what the lesson will cover, what tools will be needed, simple examples of code, tasks and objectives for each lesson, and resources for you to explore if you want to learn more about the topics covered. There will also be a folder with any files you will need to complete the lesson.

Throughout each lesson there will be a core topic such as "What is a Computer" or "Loops in Python"; this will be what the lesson is about. There will also be a list of objectives for you to complete; these will be questions about the content covered and tasks you should complete to ensure that you are learning about the topic. With the more traditional information about computer science, there will also be tie-ins to interdisciplinary themes. For the "What is a Computer" lesson, this includes interdisciplinary content such as "The physics of electricity, electrical circuits, an overview of Moore's Law, and references to an xkcd comic".

### What Is Computer Science?
According to a quick Google search<sup>[1]</sup>, computer science is defined as the following:

>computer science (noun): the study of the principles and use of computers

As you might suspect, this is a perfectly valid definition. It is not, however, the *only* definition. While unsurprisingly computer science does have a lot to do with the use of computers, it also has to do with how those computers work, and why they work in the way that they do. It has to do with how those computers came to be, and why they were first created. It has to do with the mathematics and design of computer systems, from the chip in a digital watch to the most powerful supercomputing clusters. It has to do with the impacts computers have influenced our day to day lives and the ways we interact with them. Perhaps most importantly, computer science has to do with the way computers will change in the future, and the philosophical, ethical, and technological implications those changes will bring.Computer science is not limited in scope to just learning how to program.

Consider for a moment that for much of the 20th century, the idea that a fully functional computer could fit inside your pocket would have been considered a piece of science fiction, and an unbelievable one at that. In those days, writing a program had less to do with learning the words that a particular programming language used and a whole lot more to do with punching holes in a very long strip of paper. Back then, computers were not a very large part of most peoples' daily routine. Today, we find computers in our watches, phones, refrigerators, and cars. They are in the satellites that orbit above our heads and in the giant server farms that we call 'The Cloud'. In this sense, the very idea of what a computer is or can be has changed, and will continue to change, as time goes on. With this in mind, a more holistic definition of what computer science is can be formed.

> Computer science is the study of the history, use, design, function, and change of computers.  It encompasses the technological, scientific, economic, and moral implications of the advancement of computers as well as the understanding of the people, principles, and ideas that have shaped their development.
